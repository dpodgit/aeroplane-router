**University Assignment**

**Description:** 

* Given the 4 CSV files listed below, create a fuel management and route optimisation for an airline. The program should be written in Python, OOP. 

* Each week, an aircraft must fly trips to a number of cities, and must begin and end in the same home airport. 

* The company has a number of different types of aircraft that have differing fuel capacities, and the cost of fuel varies from airport to airport. 

* Given a list of airports and a specified aircraft, the most economic route must be found. Each row in the additional "test.csv" CSV file species an aircraft, and the airports, with the home airport in first list position.

* The distance between airports should be calculated as the great circle distance between them.

* The cost of fuel is assumed to be 1 euro per 1 litre at airports where the currency is Euro.

* The cost of fuel where the currency is not Euro is assumed to be the exchange rate from the local currency to Euro (e.g. with exchange rate GBP £1 = E1.4029, 1000 litres of fuel will cost E1402.

* The fuel capacities of all aircraft are given in litres, with an assumed fuel capacity of 1 litre per km flown.

**Inputs:**

— aircraft.csv
— airport.csv
— countrycurrency.csv
— currencyrates.csv

**Output:**

— To terminal screen: Depiction of the most economic route and cost.

**Required:**
